# Welcome to Darren++!

I'm Darren Butler. I'm a Computer science and engineering student and... I love the concept of self-actualization. Honestly, I tend to think of life as a video game where we’re racking up as much experience points as possible to be the absolute, best version of ourselves. With that in mind, it’s my pleasure to write and speak about how I can help others and myself continuously level up as students, professionals, educators, or individuals in STEM.  Thanks for reading!
