#What is a personal brand?
The idea of a personal brand is quite simple. A personal brand is the collection of ideas that represent you. Just as you may associate “professionalism” with LinkedIn, a personal brand is like the first thing people associate with you.

##Why is personal branding important?
The job market is extremely competitive. I’m sure we’re all tired of hearing this, but it’s true. That’s why it is so crucial to have a personal brand. With a well-established personal brand, you stand out to recruiters or company connections looking for individuals with specific qualities.

It’s better to be a beacon. Sending hundreds of resumes and online applications is good, but there’s a better way to land an interview: be a beacon. Being a beacon means that you have established your personal brand so well that you attract like-minded people and people looking for you individuals like you. It’s possible to be called for an interview without applying. With a firm online presence for your brand, you’re easy to find, which is actually how Shadan Delevaux acquired his job as a recruiter at Google. He had started a blog on professional development, which led to articles in Ebony magazine, which then reached the right people for him to get that offer.

That’s all good, but how do I actually build my personal brand?
Just as our life’s journey is non-linear due to many twists, turns, and sudden changes so are the process of building a personal brand. However, there are concepts that help the process.

 


Your personal brand is not set in stone. You have the freedom to alter your personal brand so that it continuously and accurately represents you. Otherwise, you risk becoming disingenuous. We are constantly changing as we gain new experiences and knowledge. Once upon a time, I considered being a musician the core of my personal brand. However, the longer I held on to it as the core of my personal brand, the more uneasy I felt, which led to inner conflict and a feeling of stagnation. It’s important to give yourself the freedom to change when something in your personal brand does feel true to yourself. Additionally, personal growth can change the way you see yourself and lead to changes in your brand as well. Therefore, if something about your brand doesn’t feel right after some time, rip it up! The reality is: what you do is merely the outer layer of your personal brand.


Find your motivation. Your personal brand is not solely defined by what you do, but why you do it. Like I said before, what you do is merely the outer layer of your personal brand. People change industries. People change majors, but what tends to remain constant is the motivation behind the action. I liked music because I wanted to inspire others to do amazing things. When I transferred that motivation to STEM, I realized there was even more opportunity in making technology that helps people live their best lives. When you determine why you do a certain thing, you discover you can apply that motivation to a number of things.


Reflect. To build a personal brand, you must reflect to discover your motivation. Reflect on success and failure with detailed introspection. Ask yourself:

“Why did I pursue that opportunity or role?”
“What did I like about it?”
“What did I dislike about it?”
“How did I feel about it?”
Find moments to be alone and talk with yourself or a trusted confidant to streamline your thoughts and uncover the real you, because that is your personal brand at its best.


Be confident. Confidence is the key to building your personal brand. Not everyone will love your brand. Not everyone will be interested in your story and passion. Honestly, there may be people that try to discredit your brand, but that’s no reason to hide your potential. You have to believe in your brand. Believe that your brand has value and is worth the time and investment of others. Most importantly, make your brand the best version of you.

All the best,
